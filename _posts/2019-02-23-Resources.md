<h1 id="c-and-not-only-resources-list">C++ (and not only) resources list</h1>
<p>Here I will share with you some useful and clearly written materials concerning some non-trivial, but important areas.</p>
<h2 id="linkage">Linkage</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/42-global-variables/">https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/42-global-variables/</a></p>
<p>Cool article about scopes of visibility, variables lifetime and function linkage. I like it mostly because there are a lot of specific cases considered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/10/gcc-linking/">https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/10/gcc-linking/</a></p>
<p>The basic knowledges about how C++ linker works, pay attention to code relocation part.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lurklurk.org/linkers/linkers.html">https://www.lurklurk.org/linkers/linkers.html</a></p>
<p>Mind blowing (in a positive way of course:)) article. It is very academic, but clear for understanding. It closed about half of my gaps concerning linkage process.</p>
<h2 id="dinamic-and-static-libs">Dinamic and static libs</h2>
<p>First of all I want to say that this topic was a stumbling block for me. I cannot find a person who could clearly explain how all that stuff works. I mean I read some articles and understood the main points but I wanted to get it at a low level. And than I found this one article:<br>

<p>OMG, thank you dude this is the most apprehensible guide Iâ€™ve seen.</p>
<p>Also I really like this<br>

<h3 id="cmake">CMake</h3>

<p>This guy did a good job. All you wanted to know about 3rd parties and CMake tool.</p>
