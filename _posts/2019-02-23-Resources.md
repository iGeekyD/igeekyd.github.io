# C++ (and not only) resources list
Here I will share with you some useful and clearly written materials concerning some non-trivial, but important areas.
##  Linkage
https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/42-global-variables/
Cool article about scopes of visibility, variables lifetime and function linkage. I like it mostly because there are a lot of specific cases considered.

https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/10/gcc-linking/
The basic knowledges about how C++ linker works, pay attention to code relocation part.

Mind blowing (in a positive way of course:)) article. It is very academic, but clear for understanding. It closed about half of my gaps concerning linkage process.

## Dinamic and static libs

First of all I want to say that this topic was a stumbling block for me. I cannot find a person who could clearly explain how all that stuff works. I mean I read some articles and understood the main points but I wanted to get it at a low level. And than I found this one article:
 https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/create-libraries/index
 OMG, thank you dude this is the most apprehensible guide I've seen. 

Also I really like this

### CMake

 This guy did a good job. All you wanted to know about 3rd parties and CMake tool.
